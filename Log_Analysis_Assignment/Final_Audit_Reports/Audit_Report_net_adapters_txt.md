**Folder Name:** raw_logs
**File Types:** TXT
**Collection Date:** 2026-01-25
**Report Generated:** 2026-01-25

## 1. File Overview and Meaning
### 1.1 What Is the net_adapters.txt?
The `net_adapters.txt` file is a text-based log that lists network adapters (interfaces) on a Windows or Linux system, along with their status, MAC address, and link speed. This artifact is typically generated by network management tools for inventory purposes or troubleshooting network connectivity issues.

### 1.2 Purpose and Importance
* **Credential Discovery:** The file does not contain sensitive credentials but may reveal the presence of unauthorized network adapters, which could be indicative of an attacker's activity.
* **Forensic Analysis:** Analyzing this log can help identify active network interfaces, their statuses, and potential unauthorized devices connected to the system under investigation.

### 1.3 File Format and Structure
The file is a plain text (TXT) file with each line representing an interface. The columns are separated by tabs or spaces, and the header row lists the field names.

## 2. Data Types and Structure
### 2.1 Key Attributes or Fields
* Name: The name of the network adapter.
* InterfaceDescription: A brief description of the network interface.
* Status: The current status of the network interface (e.g., Up, Disconnected).
* MacAddress: The Media Access Control (MAC) address of the network adapter.
* LinkSpeed: The link speed of the network interface.

### 2.2 Field Descriptions
| Field Name | Data Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Name | String | The name of the network adapter. |
| InterfaceDescription | String | A brief description of the network interface. |
| Status | String | The current status of the network interface (e.g., Up, Disconnected). |
| MacAddress | String | The Media Access Control (MAC) address of the network adapter. |
| LinkSpeed | Int | The link speed of the network interface in bits per second (bps or Mbps). |

### 2.3 Sensitive or Security-Relevant Data Categories
* **Access Context:** The presence of unauthorized network adapters could indicate an attacker's activity or a compromised system.

## 3. Where This Data Is Used
### 3.1 Security Operations Use Cases
SOC teams can use this data for auditing and monitoring to identify unauthorized network interfaces, which may be indicative of an attacker's presence on the system.

### 3.2 Incident Response and Threat Hunting
IR teams can use this log to find potential attackers by identifying unauthorized network adapters that have been connected to the system under investigation.

### 3.3 Correlation With Other Artifacts
* Event Logs: Analyzing event logs in conjunction with `net_adapters.txt` can help identify suspicious activities related to network connections, such as failed login attempts or unauthorized access.
* Firewall: Examining firewall logs alongside the `net_adapters.txt` file can provide additional context about network traffic and potential threats.

## 4. Data Protection and Security Precautions
### 4.1 Why This Data Is Sensitive
If this data is leaked, it could reveal sensitive information about a system's network configuration, potentially aiding attackers in targeting the system or identifying vulnerable interfaces.

### 4.2 Storage, Access Control, and Handling
* Encryption: The `net_adapters.txt` file should be encrypted when stored to protect its contents from unauthorized access.
* Access Control: Access to this log should be restricted to authorized personnel only, with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms in place.

### 4.3 Retention and Disposal Considerations
Retain the `net_adapters.txt` file for the standard retention period specified by your organization's data retention policy. Properly dispose of the log when it is no longer needed, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed during disposal.

## 5. Sample Findings and Anomalies
### 5.1 Normal or Expected Findings
A normal `net_adapters.txt` file would list all active network interfaces
