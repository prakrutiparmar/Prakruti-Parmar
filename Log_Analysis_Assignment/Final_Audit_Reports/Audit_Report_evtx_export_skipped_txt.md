 # evtx_export_skipped Analysis Report
**Folder Name:** raw_logs
**File Types:** TXT
**Collection Date:** 2026-01-25
**Report Generated:** 2026-01-25

## 1. File Overview and Meaning
### 1.1 What Is the evtx_export_skipped Artifact?
The `evtx_export_skipped` artifact is a text file generated by tools that export Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) logs in a format other than the native .evtx format. This file contains a summary of the events skipped during the export process due to user choice or technical limitations.

### 1.2 Purpose and Importance
* **Credential Discovery:** The artifact may contain event data that could potentially reveal sensitive information, such as user accounts, service names, or timestamps, which can aid in credential discovery or privilege escalation attempts.
* **Forensic Analysis:** The skipped events may provide valuable context for ongoing investigations or incident response activities, as they might indicate unusual activity or potential security incidents that were not captured during the export process.

### 1.3 File Format and Structure
The `evtx_export_skipped` artifact is a plain text file with each line representing an event that was skipped during the export process. The format of the lines may vary depending on the tool used for exporting the logs, but they typically contain event IDs, source names, and timestamps.

## 2. Data Types and Structure
### 2.1 Key Attributes or Fields
* Event ID
* Source Name (e.g., Application, Security, System)
* Timestamp

### 2.2 Field Descriptions
| Field Name | Data Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Event ID | Integer | A unique identifier for the event. |
| Source Name | String | The name of the source (e.g., Application, Security, System) that generated the event. |
| Timestamp | DateTime | The date and time when the event occurred. |

### 2.3 Sensitive or Security-Relevant Data Categories
* **Credential Metadata:** Potentially, if the skipped events contain sensitive information such as user accounts or service names.
* **Access Context:** Depending on the source of the skipped events, they may provide context about access to resources or services within the system.

## 3. Where This Data Is Used
### 3.1 Security Operations Use Cases
* SOC teams can use this data for auditing and monitoring by reviewing the skipped events to identify unusual activity or potential security incidents that were not captured during the export process.

### 3.2 Incident Response and Threat Hunting
* IR teams can use this data to find attackers by analyzing the skipped events for indicators of compromise (IOCs) or other malicious activities.

### 3.3 Correlation With Other Artifacts
* Event Logs
* Firewall logs
* Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alerts

## 4. Data Protection and Security Precautions
### 4.1 Why This Data Is Sensitive
The data contained in the `evtx_export_skipped` artifact can potentially reveal sensitive information, which could be exploited by attackers for various malicious purposes.

### 4.2 Storage, Access Control, and Handling
* Encryption: The file should be encrypted to protect its contents from unauthorized access.
* Access Control: Access to the file should be restricted to authorized personnel only, with proper permissions set according to the principle of least privilege (PoLP).

### 4.3 Retention and Disposal Considerations
The retention period for this artifact should align with the organization's data retention policy. Once the retention period has expired, the file should be securely disposed of following appropriate disposal procedures.

## 5. Sample Findings and Anomalies
### 5.1 Normal or Expected Findings
Normal findings in this artifact would include events that were skipped due to user choice or technical limitations during the export process, such as large event volumes or specific event types not of interest for the current investigation.

### 5.2 Suspicious or High-Risk Findings (ANALYSIS OF PROVIDED LOG)
| Finding | Security Implication |
| :--- | :--- |
| Skipped events related to administrative activities, such as account management or privilege escalation, may indicate unauthorized access or
