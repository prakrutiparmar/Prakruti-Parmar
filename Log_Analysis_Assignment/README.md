# Log Analysis Assignment

## 📖 Overview
This project focuses on the systematic analysis of system and security logs to identify potential security risks, suspicious activities, and misconfigurations. The assignment simulates a real-world cybersecurity investigation where raw logs are collected, processed, and analyzed to generate actionable forensic insights.

The goal is to understand how different system artifacts can be correlated to detect threats such as unauthorized access, persistence mechanisms, and abnormal system behavior.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze system and security logs for suspicious activity
- Identify potential indicators of compromise (IoCs)
- Detect misconfigurations and risky system behavior
- Generate structured forensic findings and audit reports
- Practice real-world log analysis techniques used in cybersecurity investigations

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Areas
- **Process Creation Monitoring** – identifying suspicious or unauthorized processes
- **Login Activity Analysis** – detecting unusual login behavior
- **Persistence Mechanisms** – scheduled tasks, startup commands
- **Peripheral Activity** – USB disk usage and access
- **Network Indicators** – routing and connectivity data
- **Risk Signal Correlation** – combining multiple indicators to flag threats

---

## 📄 Reports & Findings
- All final findings are documented inside the **`Final_Audit_Reports/`** directory
- Reports summarize:
  - Detected anomalies
  - Potential security risks
  - Supporting evidence from logs
  - Observations and conclusions
